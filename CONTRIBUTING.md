# 👋 Welcome!

Welcome to Hello, World! This is an open source project for Group 4 in the IT 115 course for the Fall 2021 term. The goal of the project is to make a bunch of web application code so we can all practice managing this code on GitHub. 

## 🌎 Environment Details

Part of the class is to explore different development environments. This repository will be for code contributions from all class members. Each student should only contribute code to the directory for his/her group. The GitHub security model allows each contributor access
to the entire repository, but please be responsible and put your code in your assigned directory!

This is going to be a web application. The directory structure will work like a tree.

## 🧪 Testing

You can test the latest version of Hello, World! at this URL:

Our current testing procedure is to click on each link and check for broken links and missing pages. 

## 🐞 Bug Reports

Bugs and errors will be handled by each member, if they ever detect one by themselves. Otherwise, the bugs and errors will be discussed as a group on the discord server.

Bugs and errors that can’t be handled by the team will then be reported to the instructor, Robert Bunge:

## 🖋️ Code of Conduct

As contributors of the project, we compromise to make participation in our project and community an open space and positive experience for everyone, regardless of disability, ethnicity, gender, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation, in the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment.

### Behavior Standards
* Be welcoming and inclusive.
* Listen to others.
* Have an open mind.
* Be respectful of viewpoints and other contributor experiences.
* Allow constructive criticism.
* Communicate and inform updates.
* Focus on the goals of the project.

## 🎨 Design Structure

The design structure is described below. 
Also, the following pages are **NOT** to be added by any contributors:

* index.html
* error.html
* README.md
* CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md
* LICENSE
* CONTRIBUTING.md

If you are updating these pages for a class assignment or a group project be sure to commit the pages to
the correct repository! **NOT** the top level repository!

### At the top of the structure will be:

* index.html
* error.html
* README.md
* CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md
* LICENSE
* CONTRIBUTING.md

### At the next level will be directories for each group and for the lead author (florian):

* Florian
* Seth
* Kattiana
* Al
* Meseret

### Index.html will point to one landing page in each group's directory:

* Group4 > index.html
* Group4 > error.html
* Group4 > README.md
* Group4 > CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md
* Group4 > LICENSE
* Group4 > CONTRIBUTING.md

## 📌 Reminders

### <i>---> If you make changes to your group's landing page, please notify the instructor so the index.html can be updated at the top level.</i>

* Be sure to keep your group's content in its own folder!
* Also be sure to fix any broken links in your group's folder!
* Any stray files or directories left at the top level will be deleted.
